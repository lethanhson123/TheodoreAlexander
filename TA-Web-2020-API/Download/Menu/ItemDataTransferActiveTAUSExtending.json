Robert Jupe’s tables functioned on a revolving mechanism which required leaves to be stored separately from the table itself. Theodore Alexander’s patented mechanism allows those leaves to be ingeniously self-stored. The table can be easily expanded and this casual take on a traditional table uses inswept legs inspired by the Regency period in a more Casual Modern mood. The hewn walnut finish allows the table to be integrated in casual or modern settings and creates a wonderful textured surface that plays with light.\nThe table is part of Theodore Alexander’s NoDa Collection designed by Thor Taber. Theodore Alexander also offers this patented function on several Modern, Casual and Classic styles.\n","VariationDescription":null,"ExtendedDescription":"Extending<br>Hewn Veneer<br>Hewn Hazel

His original version of the table twisted outwards to make room for eight leaves. These leaves had to be stored in a separate, external cabinet. Theodore Alexander has modified and patented the original design to eliminate the need for a separate cabinet. Through an ingenious technique of storing the leaves underneath the pull out sections this table has become very effective in managing space. However, it retains the original Regency proportions and design envisaged by Robert Jupe when he patented the table in 1835. Original Jupe tables have achieved vast sums at auctions and are highly sought after. This table, now part of the Althorp Living History Collection, is an enduring technical and aesthetic design icon of its very own.","VariationDescription":"Medium Sheen","ExtendedDescription":"A circular extending mahogany dining table crossbanded with burl and morado, the top is formed of eight pull -
